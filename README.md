## STAG

### What is it?
It's the command line interface for Statamic. It allows you to do all
sorts of wonderful things. But mainly don't want to have to SSH into
remote servers to manage, deploy or administrate your Statamic
site.

### Who is it for?
Currently stag is in BETA. Which means that it's not thouroughly tested,
so it'd be better if you had a little know into what's happening. stag
is a command line interface, so comfort with the command line is a must.
If you're using it with a remote server somewhere, not only is is
required that you are able to ssh into the server, it'd be super helpful
if you are comfortable enough to ssh into that server and get around
incase anything goes wrong. So you are a command line enthusiast looking
to make your Statamic life a little easier but wielding the stag.

## DISCLAIMER
Stag is in beta version. It's not only kind of a requirement anymore
that your code is under some sort of version control, it'd be helpful
to backup your code base incase the worst happens. If you don't have
version control or don't know how to use it to revert back to a certain
state in the code, please proceed with extreme caution. That being said,
I am using it in a production environment, and continue to. IF all that
sounds good to you, then proceed to:
